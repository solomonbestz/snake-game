HOW GAMES WORK IN GENERAL

A GAME LOOP Draws images and other elements to the screen multiple times per second

1) Get Player Input (You need to know what the player wants to do)
2) Position elements (in each cycle you need to position elements in position it needs to be drawn)
3) Draw all the elements


Mario Game Example

1) Players presses 'right'
2) Move Mario 5 pixel right
3) Draw all graphics (Mario now on a new position)

All of the above would happen in one cycle of the game loop 
1 cycle = 17 milliseconds
-> 60 cycles per second


Framarate: How many times you want something to run per seconds

Drawing Shapes in Pygame
(Surfaces and Rectangles!)

Surfaces: Surfaces has two types (Display Surface and Regular Surface)

Display Surface: It is the canvas the entire game is drawn on and There is only 1 display surface and it is displayed by default

Regular Surface: It is a layer that can display graphics, There can be multiple surfaces and it is not displayed by default but instead on the display surface.


HOW TO USE SURFACES

1) Create a surface (either import an image, write text, or create an empty space)
2) Display the surface


TWO WAYS TO FILLING A SURFACE WITH COLOR

1) RGB Tuple
2) Color Object -> pygame.Color(color_name)


Rect (Rectangle)

A rectangle that can be used for drawing, placement, movement and collisions



LOGIC OF THE SNAKE GAME

1) We are creating a grid like display
2) Some blocks are snake blocks


An easy way to store 2d data (Vector2)

Moving The snake

The head is moved to a new block

The block before the head gets the position where the
head used to be

Each block is moved to the position of the block that used to be before it (this deletes the last block)

THINGS NEEDED TO MAKE THE SNAKE Move

1) We need player Input
2) We need a timer
